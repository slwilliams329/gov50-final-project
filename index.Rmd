## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the Supreme Court of the United States. I am unsure as to what data exists on this, but I have been thinking about a project analyzing how rulings have changed over time. Some examples: Has the Court been more or less unified in its rulings over time? How many cases having to do with the First Amendment have been on the docket over time?
